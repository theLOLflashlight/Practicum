/**
 * @namespace smath
 * Global namespace of static_math.
 *
 * Every function of static_math lives in this namespace.
 * The library does not contain any other namespace.
 *
 * All the functions in this library are meant to be used
 * at compile time. Though can also be used at runtime, it's
 * generally not a good idea: the functions are implemented
 * in a way they can actually run at compile time, often at
 * the expense of performance. The global idea is that
 * performance of the functions is not an issue since all
 * will just be computed once.
 *
 * If you want some powerful and fast mathematical functions,
 * you better use those in the standard library or Boost or
 * any library dedicated to maths.
